1. What are the general programming practices that are important with respect to 
performance in java?

First and foremost- no premature optimizations. Any optimization decision should be
based on number of past experience. In Donald knuths paper - Progamming waste 
enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about, the speed of non critical
parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong impact
when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small optimizations
is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up on opportunities in that critical  3%

Minimize number of objects crated :
  Avoid String concatenation: Use StringBuffer.
  Aviud creatubg object in Loops,
  Consider pattern like flyweight
  
Use correct data structures :
  Use the right collections for a situation
  Use a proper domian model.
  
Reducwe web aplication overhead
  small session size.
  Use cacahing where appropriate.
  Close connections and strems.
  
Tuen you database:
  Have indexex.
  Tune your queries
  If you are using hibernate, understand the intenral of hibernate
  Avoid     N+1 selects peroblem
  Enable statistics on Database.
